Inspired by http://www.technoreply.com/how-to-install-sublime-text-2-on-ubuntu-12-04-unity/

Usage
-----

Run this in the shell:

    wget https://github.com/khink/sublimetext-installer/raw/master/sublime-install.sh
    chmod 700 sublime-install.sh
    ./sublime-install.sh

SublimeText Versions
--------------------

This script targets SublimeText 2, for which no easier install method is available.
It should also work on the tarball for SublimeText 3, but i'd use the ``.deb`` for that.
